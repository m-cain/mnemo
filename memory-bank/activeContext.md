# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are developing an inventory management system with a React frontend and a Go backend. The system allows users to track inventory items, categorize them by types, and assign locations. The frontend uses React with TypeScript, TanStack Query and Router, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Recent Changes

- Added sorting capabilities to the inventory table on ItemListPage:
  - Implemented column header sorting with visual indicators
  - Support for sorting by name, item type, location, and quantity
  - Toggle between ascending and descending order
  - Visual feedback showing current sort column and direction
- Enhanced the ItemDetailPage with:
  - Card-based layout with responsive grid design
  - Improved visual organization of item information
  - Added quantity adjustment dialog for quick inventory updates
  - Better error state handling and visual feedback
  - Low stock indicator with badge
- Improved the CreateItemForm with:
  - Organized sections for better information hierarchy
  - Enhanced validation with field-level error messages
  - Added a helpful tips card with guidance for users
  - Better form submission feedback and loading states
- Created missing UI components (Input, Textarea) for consistent styling
- Added statistics cards to the ItemListPage to show total items, item types, locations count, and low stock items
- Implemented search functionality with item type filtering
- Enhanced the inventory table with better organization and styling

## UI Component Structure

The inventory management UI now includes:

1. ItemListPage:

   - Statistics dashboard showing key metrics (total quantities, item types, locations, low stock)
   - Advanced search bar with clear button functionality
   - Item type filtering using a popover component
   - Responsive inventory table with improved styling
   - Sortable columns with ascending/descending indicators (name, type, location, quantity)
   - Low stock indicators with badges

2. ItemDetailPage:

   - Two-column card layout (3-column on larger screens)
   - Item details card with organized information sections
   - Quantity and location card with adjustment controls
   - Confirm dialog for quantity adjustments
   - Consistent error and empty states

3. CreateItemForm:
   - Two-column layout with form and tips cards
   - Organized sections for different types of information
   - Improved validation with field-level feedback
   - Clear required field indicators
   - Guidance tips for better user experience

## Next Steps

1. Create dashboard visualizations (charts, graphs) for inventory analytics
2. Implement bulk operations (import/export, multi-select delete/edit)
3. Improve the home selection UI (currently using a placeholder)
4. Add more comprehensive input validation
5. Add pagination for inventory tables with large datasets

## Technical Decisions

- Using shadcn/ui for component library to ensure consistent styling and functionality
- Using relative imports (../../../) instead of alias imports (@/) to avoid path resolution issues
- Implementing type-safe React event handlers
- Utilized the magic UI component generator for inspiration on advanced UI patterns

## User Experience Focus

- Making inventory status visible at a glance with the stats cards
- Simplifying search, filtering, and sorting operations
- Ensuring responsive design works across device sizes
- Using clear visual indicators for item status (low stock, sorting direction)
