# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are developing an inventory management system with a React frontend and a Go backend. The system allows users to track inventory items, categorize them by types, and assign locations. The frontend uses React with TypeScript, TanStack Query and Router, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Recent Changes

- Added statistics cards to the ItemListPage to show total items, item types, locations count, and low stock items
- Implemented a search functionality with item type filtering
- Enhanced the inventory table with better organization and styling
- Added Shadcn UI components for a more professional look and feel
- Integrated the 21st-dev/magic MCP server to generate sophisticated UI components

## UI Component Structure

The enhanced ItemListPage now includes:

1. Statistics dashboard showing key metrics (total quantities, item types, locations, low stock)
2. Advanced search bar with clear button functionality
3. Item type filtering using a popover component
4. Responsive inventory table with improved styling
5. Low stock indicators with badges

## Next Steps

1. Complete the ItemDetailPage with similar styling patterns
2. Enhance the CreateItemForm with improved UX
3. Implement item quantity adjustment functionality
4. Add sorting capabilities to the inventory table
5. Create dashboard visualizations (charts, graphs) for inventory analytics
6. Implement bulk operations (import/export, multi-select delete/edit)

## Technical Decisions

- Using shadcn/ui for component library to ensure consistent styling and functionality
- Using relative imports (../../../) instead of alias imports (@/) to avoid path resolution issues
- Implementing type-safe React event handlers
- Utilized the magic UI component generator for inspiration on advanced UI patterns

## User Experience Focus

- Making inventory status visible at a glance with the stats cards
- Simplifying search and filtering operations
- Ensuring responsive design works across device sizes
- Using clear visual indicators for item status (low stock)
