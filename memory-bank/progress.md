# Progress

This document summarizes the current status of the project, what is working, what is left to build, and any known issues. It also reflects on the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- Project planning and architecture design are complete
- Data model design with self-referential location hierarchy
- Implementation phases and timeline have been established
- Component structure for both backend and frontend has been defined

## What's Left to Build

- Entire system implementation:
  1. Project initialization and environment setup
  2. Database schema implementation and migrations
  3. Authentication system (user registration, login, API keys)
  4. Core API services for inventory management
  5. Location hierarchy implementation with recursive queries
  6. Frontend PWA with React and Shadcn components
  7. Barcode scanning and camera integration
  8. Search functionality with NLP capabilities
  9. Visual location management system
  10. Integration with external APIs (e.g., Google Books)
  11. Performance optimization and security hardening
  12. Documentation and deployment guides

## Current Status

- Planning phase complete; project is ready for implementation
- Project structure defined with the following key components:
  - Go 1.24 backend with Chi v5 router
  - PostgreSQL 17 database with pgx v5
  - React/TypeScript frontend with Shadcn components
  - PWA configuration for cross-platform accessibility
- Implementation planned in phased approach with clear milestones

## Known Issues

- No implementation issues yet as development has not begun
- Potential challenges identified:
  - Performance optimization for recursive location queries
  - Camera API integration across different devices
  - Ensuring seamless offline functionality for PWA
  - Secure handling of API keys and sensitive data

## Evolution of Decisions

- Initial data model evolved to support flexible location hierarchies using a self-referential design
- Original storage concept was merged into a unified location entity for better flexibility
- Implementation approach shifted to a more progressive model, focusing on core functionality first
- Decision to use direct SQL over ORM made based on performance and debugging considerations
- Frontend architectural decisions guided by the need for PWA capabilities and responsive design
