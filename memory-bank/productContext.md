# Product Context

This document explains the "why" behind the project. It describes the problems the project aims to solve, how it should work from a user perspective, and the overall user experience goals.

## Problem Statement

- Managing home inventory is typically cumbersome, fragmented, and inefficient, often relying on manual records or scattered digital solutions.
- Difficulty in keeping inventory updated in real-time, especially with varying item types, quantities, and storage locations.
- Lack of robust tools to quickly identify, catalog, and track household items, leading to disorganization and inefficiencies.
- Current solutions do not provide seamless integration with other household systems or intelligent assistance tools.

## How it Works

- Users create a "Home" entity within the system, establishing their personal inventory management environment.
- Users can invite others, assigning roles and permissions, ensuring collaborative and controlled access.
- Inventory items are added either manually or through the mobile application's camera, leveraging barcode scanning and image recognition to identify and catalog items efficiently.
- Users can track detailed quantities and specific metrics such as weight or volume, depending on the type of item.
- Items are associated with clearly defined storage locations, which users manage visually through the application, enabling intuitive retrieval and management.
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities powered by NLP enhance accessibility and management of inventory data.
- Users can generate static API keys for integration with external systems, expanding functionality and enabling automation.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide a seamless, intuitive user interface that simplifies and accelerates inventory management tasks.
- Enable quick and effortless onboarding of new items through advanced camera recognition and barcode processing.
- Facilitate collaborative inventory management through clear and secure user role management.
- Ensure users always have accurate, real-time visibility into their inventory status and locations.
- Support easy integration and extensibility, allowing users to leverage their home inventory data across various platforms and devices.
