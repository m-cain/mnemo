# Project Brief

This document serves as the foundational document for the project, defining its core requirements, goals, and overall scope. It is the source of truth for the project's purpose and direction.

## Core Requirements

- Self-hosted home inventory tracking
- Authentication and user management

  - Create and manage a "Home" entity
  - Invite users with configurable roles
  - Generate static API keys for external integrations

- Inventory tracking capabilities

  - Track items, quantities, and relevant measurements (e.g., weight for food)
  - Easy updating of quantities and states over time
  - Barcode scanning and processing capabilities
  - Object identification using camera and local image models
  - Integration with external APIs (e.g., Google Books) for data enrichment

- Robust inventory management front-end

  - NLP-based search
  - Advanced filtering options

- Location and spatial management

  - Manage multiple locations (e.g., primary home, vacation home, relativesâ€™ homes)
  - Define detailed room and storage configurations (rooms, shelves, cabinets, drawers)
  - Visual management capabilities (importing floor plans, generating manifests from images)

## Project Goals

- Simplify the management and tracking of home inventory
- Enable flexible use cases including potential future SaaS offerings
- Streamline inventory updates and accessibility via intuitive UI/UX
- Facilitate integrations with other systems and tools through well-designed APIs

## Scope

- Includes:

  - Core inventory tracking functionalities (item identification, quantity management, barcode processing)
  - Front-end camera application for object identification and barcode scanning
  - API-driven backend with extensible authentication and integration capabilities
  - Detailed spatial management for inventory locations
  - Data backup, recovery, and security management

- Excludes:

  - Direct implementation of external agentic AI integrations (though API compatibility is within scope)
  - Immediate SaaS deployment considerations (though flexibility for future implementation should be ensured)
  - Implementation of unrelated features beyond primary inventory management objectives

## Data Backup and Security

- Regular automatic backups of inventory data to secure, remote locations
- Robust recovery mechanisms allowing restoration from backups
- Data encryption for sensitive user information and stored API keys
- Comprehensive access control mechanisms to ensure data integrity
- Audit logging for user actions and API interactions to detect anomalies and support security audits
